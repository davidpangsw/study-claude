- Read taskFile and exploreFile (see /develop for file paths).
- The plan should:
    - be able to be implemented without confusion
    - include all information for coder to implement. The coder wouldn't read taskFile and exploreFile.
- Also read planReviewFile if the file exists (if not, ignore this part):
    - There would be a list of reviews sorted by priority, only work on items with priority higher than "Low".
- Produce/Edit your plan to achieve the task, into the planFile.
