- Read taskFile, exploreFile and planFile (see /develop for file paths).
- Review the plan in planFile.
- Produce/Edit your result into the planReviewFile:
    - Make/edit a list of suggestions on the plan.
        - Sort the suggestions by Priority. (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
        - Delete previous useless/redundant suggestions if any.
    - The plan should:
        - be able to be implemented without confusion
        - include all information for coder to implement, as the coder wouldn't read taskFile and exploreFile.
